# 🗣️ Expo Module for iOS Speech Recognition

This is a custom **Expo Module** that wraps iOS’s native **Speech framework** to bring speech-to-text capabilities into your **React Native** app.

With this module, you can access real-time voice transcription using Apple’s built-in speech recognition — fully integrated within an Expo project.
